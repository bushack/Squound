also categoriesview needs to be updated to make use of the category service
that is also used by the coarse search page, this will allow us to 
ensure that both display the same categories without having to manually 
hardwire them in both places

following this we need to hook up the keyword search facility and then amend
the product listing page to fetch the selected product by Id along with all
product images of various sizes. Then we can apapt the page to allow the user
to scroll and zoom in on the product images etc
