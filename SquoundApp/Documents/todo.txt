Remember
	- ViewModels are page logic, they request data from repositories or services and they administer views, they contain no state
	- Repositories cache state, and allow viewModels to read that state
	- Services are the workhorses, they retrieve data and pass it to the source of the request, usually a repo

Pagination
	- Check functionality of Previous Page and Next Page when more items added to database

Logging
	- Set logging levels in API Program.cs

	- Ask!

Contexts
	- Package complimentary services etc into appropriate contexts which can then be injected into ctors
	- Beware circular dependancies

Events
	- Remember, events can be subscribed to, should a class need to know when something happens
	- Remember, classes that subscribe to events will remain in memory until they unsubscribe, even if they are transient
	- Use weak events to avoid memory leaks?

Images

	- JPEG, Aspect ratio of 4:5, compress to ~80-90% quality for balance
	- Strip metadata (EXIF) to save space & bandwidth (exiftool for Windows command line)
	- Support dynamic query parameters (eg. sideboard.jpg?w=800&h=1000) to request best image resolution
	- Small		→ 400x500	→ .jpg @ ~50-80KB
	- Medium	→ 800x1000	→ .jpg @ ~100-160KB
	- Large		→ 1200x1500	→ .jpg @ ~350-500KB
	- XLarge	→ 1600x2000	→ .jpg @ ~500-999KB
	- XXLarge	→ 2000x2500	→ .jpg @ ~1-2MB?
